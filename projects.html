                    <h2>Tin Dog</h2>
                    <p>I designed and developed the Tin Dog website using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a modern and interactive platform. The website features a responsive layout that ensures optimal viewing and interaction across various devices. Leveraging Bootstrap's grid system and components, I implemented a visually appealing interface with consistent styling and smooth navigation. JavaScript was utilized to enhance user interactivity, incorporating features such as carousel sliders for showcasing Tin Dog's features and services. The use of HTML5 and CSS3 allowed for structuring content and styling elements to meet both aesthetic and functional requirements. This project demonstrates my proficiency in frontend technologies and my ability to create engaging web experiences through effective design and development practices.</p>

                    <h2>Drum Kit</h2>
                    <p>I developed an interactive drum kit website primarily using JavaScript to create an engaging and educational tool for users. The project involved implementing event listeners to capture keyboard and mouse inputs, triggering corresponding drum sounds and animations, thereby enhancing user interaction and engagement. Leveraging advanced JavaScript concepts such as functions, event handling, and DOM manipulation, I created a seamless and responsive user experience. The drum kit website was designed to be fully responsive, ensuring accessibility and visual appeal across various devices and screen sizes. I also incorporated visual feedback through animations and transitions, providing users with an intuitive and immersive experience. By integrating high-quality drum sound files, I ensured realistic and enjoyable sound playback. This project highlights my ability to utilize JavaScript for interactive web applications and underscores my skills in responsive design and user experience optimization.</p>
